Hi, I’m @IKAZstudios!
I mostly code python, but I also do
a lot of html and php!

I use python to:
+ Create games
+ Create useful applications using tkinter
+ Host webpages


I do have a website that I host myself,
but I am not going to put a link here as
it probaly has quite a few security issuses.
